Here is the code for reaction-driven cracking:
The pressure_displacement_profile.m is ready to get the non-dimensional pressure/stress and displacement/opening profile along the crack. With "farfield" one is to consider the far-field/background stress.
The K_time.m is ready for the non-dimensional stress intensity factor evolving with non-dimensional time.
The K_maxH.m is for non-dimensional stress intensity factor versus the maximum opening at the center of crack.
The final_length.m is for the estimate of final propagation length.
